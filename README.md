# Self-Assessment  

## Functionality - 3  
I rate my project as a **3 - Meets Expectations** in the *Functionality* category of the rubric. I was able to create the Enigma class with the encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. In addition, I successfully implemented the command line interfaces using the applicable runner files.

## Object Oriented Programming - 3  
I rate my project as a **3 - Meets Expectations** in the *Object Oriented Programming* category of the rubric. I broke the project down into three logical components representing the three different pieces of information, or objects, that are included in message encryption/decryption - the message (Message class), the key (Key class), and the offset (Offset class). Each class is encapsulated and each class has a single responsibility. The Key class creates the four keys, the offset class creates the four offsets, and the message class encrypts or decrypts the message based on the keys and offsets returned by their respective classes. In addition, no classes are unreasonably small or large, with the largest class a total of 100 lines and the complete project running 172 total lines of code.

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 3  
I rate my project as a **3 - Meets Expectations** in the *Ruby Conventions and Mechanics* category of the rubric. All of my code is properly indented and spaced, and no lines are excessively long. In addition, I followed all Ruby conventions when creating class, method, variable, and file names.
